MzansiVerse Privacy Policy

Mzansi Digital Apps (“MzansiVerse”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) operates a suite of mobile applications and games designed for South African users, including but not limited to digital wallets, games, education platforms, healthcare connectors, marketplaces, and entertainment services.

Information We Collect
We may collect limited personal and non-personal information including:
- Device information
- App usage analytics
- Advertising identifiers
- In-app activity related to rewards, gameplay, or services

This information is collected to improve user experience, ensure platform security, enable rewards, and support monetization through ads and services.

Advertising
Our apps may display advertisements provided by third-party partners such as Google AdMob. These partners may use advertising identifiers to show relevant ads. Users can opt out of ad personalization through their device settings.

Mzansi Currency & Rewards
Some apps include a virtual rewards system (“Mzansi Currency”). This currency has no real-world cash value unless explicitly stated and is used for in-app rewards, features, or participation incentives.

Payments
Where applicable, payments may be processed via trusted third-party payment providers. Mzansi Digital Apps does not store sensitive payment details directly on its servers.

Data Sharing
We do not sell personal data. Data may be shared with trusted service providers strictly for analytics, advertising, notifications, or app functionality.

Children’s Privacy
MzansiVerse apps are not knowingly targeted at children under 13 unless explicitly stated. If personal data is discovered to have been collected unintentionally, it will be deleted.

Security
We take reasonable measures to protect user information but cannot guarantee absolute security.

Changes to This Policy
This policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of our apps constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
